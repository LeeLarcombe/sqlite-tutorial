# SQLite Tutorial
An introduction to using SQLite at the command line (using biological data examples)
 
 This tutorial is intended to be run on www.repl.it - but if you download the files you can run it on a local bash/sqlite environment.
 
 --- 
 ### Running on repl.it
  
  You can either: 
   - Visit repl.it without the need to create an account, click "start coding" and use the import from github function (giving github.com/LeeLarcombe/sqlite-tutorial) as the repo name;
   - Log in to repl.it if you already have an account and create a persistant repl from the github repo that way;
   - Directly launch a repl from the github repo using the link http://www.repl.it/github/LeeLarcombe/sqlite-tutorial

   ### When you are running on repl.it
   
   You should be able to see the files for the tutorial in the files pane on the left side of the screen - this file in the centre panel - and a command prompt window on the right.
   
   When you are ready to begin, select the tutorial file (sqlite-tutorial.md) in the files pane - and follow all of the steps by typing the commands in the command prompt window.
   
   *(sometimes the command prompt ">" is not ready - just hit return in the command prompt window and it will appear)*
